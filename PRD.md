# Fabric Inventory Management System - PRD ## Technical Architecture & Stack
### Core Technology Stack

#### MVP Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS (mobile-focused web app)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT-based)
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment**: Hostinger
- **Backend**: Direct Supabase client integration (no custom backend for MVP)

#### Future Architecture (Post-MVP)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum (as system complexity grows)
- **Deployment**: Railway or Fly.io

#### Public Sales Catalog
- **Framework**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS (integrated with main app)
- **Deployment**: Hostinger

#### Additional Services
- **PDF Generation**: For barcode printing
- **Barcode Generation**: QR codes for stock units
- **Image Processing**: Product image optimization
- **Monitoring**: Built-in Railway/Fly.io analytics
- **Real-time Updates**: Not in Phase 1 (future consideration)

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single App Approach**: Admins manage products/inventory through mobile app (no separate web dashboard)
- **Multi-tenant**: Company-based isolation with warehouse-level staff access
- **Role-based Access**: Admin (full access) + Staff (warehouse-specific)
- **Mobile-first**: Primary interface for all inventory operations

## Problem & Opportunity

India's textile industry (₹20.1 lakh crore/$240.8B market) has 96.66% unorganized production flowing through intermediary traders to reach the domestic market (70% of production). These fabric traders lack specialized inventory tools—existing solutions are either too generic (TallyPrime, Vyapar) or too complex (enterprise ERPs). With 2.5 crore traders now eligible for MSME registration, there's a clear digitization opportunity.

### Market Size

- **TAM:** ₹18.5 lakh crore/$222B textile market (growing 11.98% CAGR)
- **SAM:** Fabric trading intermediary layer (70% of domestic production)
- **SOM:** ₹14-70 crore (1-5% penetration of eligible MSME traders)

### Solution

**Vision:** Digitize India's fabric trading ecosystem with purpose-built tools

**Positioning:** "The only inventory management platform designed specifically for fabric - not too simple like generic software, not too complex like enterprise ERP, but just right for fabric"

**Core Value Props:**
- Fabric-specific inventory tracking (roll, color, weight, quality)
- Trading workflow optimization

**Competitive Advantage:**
- **vs Generic Software:** Built for fabric specifications
- **vs Enterprise ERP:** Right-sized complexity and cost
- **vs Textile Apps:** Comprehensive inventory beyond basic transactions
